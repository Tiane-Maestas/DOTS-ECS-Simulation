# DOTS-ECS-Simulation
Initially this was suppposed to be a large scale simulation of particles as a gas for a school project using ECS, but this turnned out to be way too much work using ECS
so I decided to just create a regualr simulation using normal GameObjects. Maybe one day I'll come back for the ECS implementation but for now the ECS part isn't finished.
